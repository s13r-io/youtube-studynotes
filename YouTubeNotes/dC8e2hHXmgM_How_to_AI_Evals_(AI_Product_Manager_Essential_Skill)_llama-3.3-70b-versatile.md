**Unlocking AI Evals: A Crucial Skill for Product Managers**
#AI #ProductManagement #Evals #GenAI #PM

### 1. THE HOOK
Imagine being able to assess and improve the performance of your AI systems without relying on manual reviews. AI evaluations, or AI evals, are a game-changer for product managers, enabling them to define success across multiple dimensions and iterate quickly on Gen AI systems. But what are AI evals, and how can you leverage them in your craft?

### 2. CORE CONCEPT — The WHAT and WHY
**AI evals** are a way to assess your Gen AI system on not just **correctness** but also on more subjective dimensions like **quality** or **tone**. Think of it like evaluating a customer support bot's response to a stressed-out parent with a sick kid - there are many ways to respond, but what makes a perfect output? AI evals help define what you consider a perfect output to be for each given scenario, allowing you to instill nuance and iterate quickly on Gen AI systems. But why is this important? In traditional software, systems are **deterministic**, meaning you can assess their correctness with unit tests. However, with Gen AI systems, the same inputs yield slightly different outputs, making AI evals a crucial tool for product managers.

### 3. HOW IT WORKS — The HOW
To set up an eval system, follow these steps:
1. **Create goldens**: Input and output test scenarios that have been curated by humans as perfect examples, covering key scenarios and edge cases.
2. **Generate synthetic data**: Use LLMs to generate synthetic data based on your goldens, augmenting your data set and allowing for more comprehensive testing.
3. **Grade outputs**: Humans should grade the synthetic data across various dimensions, defining the source of truth for your AI system.
4. **Build autoraators**: Create an AI system that grades your main AI system, using the goldens and synthetic data to build a baseline for evaluation.

Let's consider a real-world example: a customer support bot for a bank. To create goldens, you might define input and output test scenarios like:
* Input: "I want to refund my order"
* Output: "Happy to help. Let me start the refund process. Was there anything wrong with your order?"
* Input: "Your customer service is the worst. I'm so angry."
* Output: "I apologize for the frustration. Let me pass you on to an agent. What's the best number to reach you?"

### 4. THREE PERSPECTIVES
**Perspective 1: Real-World Application**
AI evals are used in practice to improve the performance of Gen AI systems, such as customer support bots, image generation, and frontline nurse bots. For example, a company like Anthropic uses AI evals to assess the quality of their AI-generated content.

**Perspective 2: Technical Deep-Dive**
Under the hood, AI evals rely on techniques like **LLMs** (Large Language Models) to generate synthetic data and **autoraators** to evaluate the performance of Gen AI systems. The choice of evaluation metrics, such as **FID** (Fréchet Inception Distance) for image generation, can significantly impact the effectiveness of AI evals.

**Perspective 3: Common Pitfall**
Here's where people stumble: failing to define clear evaluation criteria and relying too heavily on human review. To avoid this, it's essential to create comprehensive goldens, generate high-quality synthetic data, and continually refine your autoraators.

### 5. PRACTICAL CHEAT SHEET
* **When Relevant:** Use AI evals when working with Gen AI systems, especially in applications where subjective dimensions like quality or tone are crucial.
* **Watch Out For:** Failing to define clear evaluation criteria and relying too heavily on human review.
* **Quick Win:** Start by creating a small set of goldens and generating synthetic data to build a baseline for evaluation.
* **Common Confusion:** Confusing AI evals with traditional software testing methods, which are not suitable for Gen AI systems.
* **Limitations:** AI evals are not a replacement for human review, but rather a tool to augment and improve the evaluation process.

### 6. KEY TERMS GLOSSARY
* **AI evals**: Evaluations of Gen AI systems on subjective dimensions like quality or tone.
* **Goldens**: Input and output test scenarios curated by humans as perfect examples.
* **Synthetic data**: Data generated by LLMs based on goldens.
* **Autoraators**: AI systems that grade the performance of Gen AI systems.
* **LLMs**: Large Language Models used for generating synthetic data and building autoraators.

### 7. MEMORY ANCHORS
**One-Sentence Summary:** AI evals are a crucial tool for product managers to assess and improve the performance of Gen AI systems.
**The Analogy to Remember:** Evaluating a Gen AI system is like assessing a customer support bot's response to a stressed-out parent - you need to define what makes a perfect output.
